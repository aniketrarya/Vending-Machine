# Vending-Machine
Implementation of Verilog and Finite state Machine
The project builds on a Vending Machine using finite state machines. The Vending Machine takes in two different coins of worth 5 and 10 respectively and in turn increases the state accordingly. The machine dispenses out the item selected once its state is reached. It even gives out change if hiher state is achieved.
